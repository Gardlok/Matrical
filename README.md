# Matrical

## Overview
Matrical is a Rust library designed for efficient and flexible handling of matrices. It introduces the concepts of Gears and Attributes to provide a powerful and flexible way to manage and manipulate matrices. The library is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use. However, it is open for contributions from anyone interested in its development.

## Intended Purposes
Matrical is intended to provide a robust and flexible framework for working with matrices in Rust. It is designed with the following goals in mind:

Efficiency: Matrical aims to provide efficient operations for manipulating matrices, minimizing computational overhead and memory usage.

Flexibility: With the concepts of Gears and Attributes, Matrical allows for a wide range of operations and manipulations on matrices, making it adaptable to a variety of use cases.

Ease of Use: Despite its power and flexibility, Matrical strives to maintain a simple and intuitive API, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced Rust developers.

## Roadmap
While Matrical is still in the early stages of development, the following is a rough roadmap of planned features and improvements:

Enhanced Gear and Attribute Functionality: Improve the functionality of Gears and Attributes, allowing for more complex operations and manipulations on matrices.

Performance Optimizations: Implement performance optimizations to ensure that Matrical can handle large matrices efficiently.

Expanded API: Expand the API to include more operations and manipulations on matrices.

Documentation and Examples: Provide comprehensive documentation and examples to help users understand and effectively use Matrical.

Testing and Stability: Implement thorough testing to ensure the stability and reliability of Matrical.
